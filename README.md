# desktopGPT

Desktop app for chatting with chatGPT using your own API key

## How to use

You can look at the code and built it yourself. Just a heads up, the API key you enter through the UI will be stored in local storage, so use
at your own risk.

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run the app in dev mode
npm run tauri dev

# build install file - requires C++ build tools and Rust installed
npm run tauri build
```

## Future features
